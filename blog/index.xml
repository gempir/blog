      <description>As a small disclaimer: I am a PHP developer in my day job and I love PHP. This is in no way a criticism of PHP.
I wanted to start using a password manager, since iâ€™ve heard a lot about them and a lot of good things. The first one coming to my mind was LastPass because I have heard it somewhere on reddit or so before. After creating an account, I wanted to add 2-Factor-Authentication, because losing my LastPass account would equal losing every password of mine.</description>
